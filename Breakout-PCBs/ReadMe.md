- A breakout is a board that makes specific use easier, in this cause for Lightguns.

## Features

## Warnings

### If using with [P.I.G.S.](https://github.com/Fusion-Lightguns/P.I.G.S--Pico-Infared-Gun-System)

- I am working on making it automatic setup with KeeBoar2040.


### If you are using GUN4IR, OpenFire, Blamcon etc. 
  
- I cant provide any support for this. I will tell you a lot them let you remap the pins and could work in theory.
- This is made for KB2040 or Pro Micro. Other micrcontrollers wont fit .
