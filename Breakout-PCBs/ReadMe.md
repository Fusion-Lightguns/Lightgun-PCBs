# Breakout PCBs

## Info
- These PCBs are designed to be used as "breakouts" for exsisting Micro Controllers.
- A breakout is a board that makes specific use easier, in this cause fro Lightguns.

## Warnings
- If using with [P.I.G.S.](https://github.com/Fusion-Lightguns/P.I.G.S--Pico-Infared-Gun-System)

    You have to use the breakout uf2 files. You will find them in [releases](https://github.com/Fusion-Lightguns/P.I.G.S--Pico-Infared-Gun-System/releases).(coming soon)
    If you dont use the breakout uf2 files it will NOT act right.

- If you are using GUN4IR, GUN4ALL or other pro micro/kb2040 based lightgun systems.

    I cant provide any support for this. I will tell you a lot them let you remap the pins and could work in theory.
