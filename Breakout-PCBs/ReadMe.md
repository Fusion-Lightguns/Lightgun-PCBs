# Breakout PCBs

## Info
- These PCBs are designed to be used as "breakouts" for exsisting Micro Controllers.
- A breakout is a board that makes specific use easier, in this cause for Lightguns.
- This idea started with pro micro and old code in 2022.

## Features 
- Spots for screw or JST connectors.
- Order assembled from JLCPCB with screw connectors.

## Warnings

### If using with [P.I.G.S.](https://github.com/Fusion-Lightguns/P.I.G.S--Pico-Infared-Gun-System)
- I am working on making it automatic setup with KeeBoar2040.
- ATM doesnt exactly work.

### If you are using GUN4IR, OpenFire, Blamcon etc. 
  
- I cant provide any support for this. I will tell you a lot them let you remap the pins and could work in theory.
- Use correct BreakOut made for microcontroller. Otherwise micrcontrollers wont fit .

Example Keeboar2040 are just for KB2040 and pro micro. The pro micro and kb2040 are sane size .
