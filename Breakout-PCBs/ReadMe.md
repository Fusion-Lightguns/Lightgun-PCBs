# Breakout PCBs

## Info
- These PCBs are designed to be used as "breakouts" for exsisting Micro Controllers.
- A breakout is a board that makes specific use easier, in this cause fro Lightguns.

## Warnings
- If using with [P.I.G.S.](https://github.com/Fusion-Lightguns/P.I.G.S--Pico-Infared-Gun-System)
- I am working on making it automatic setup with KeeBoar2040.
- 
- If you are using GUN4IR, GUN4ALL or other pro micro/kb2040 based lightgun systems.
    I cant provide any support for this. I will tell you a lot them let you remap the pins and could work in theory.
